**A POSTMORTEM (INCIDENT REPORT) FOR OUR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM**

ISSUE SUMMARY.
On May 8, 2024, at 10:45 AM UTC, our e-commerce platform experienced a 2-hour outage, affecting approximately 30% of our users. During this period, users were unable to place orders or access their accounts, resulting in significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction. A erroneously setup database connection was the primary cause of the outage, which resulted in a cascade failure of the backend services for our application.

TIMELINE.
10:45 AM UTC - Our monitoring system detected an issue and alerted our on-call engineer about a surge in error rates and slow response times
10:50 AM UTC - The engineer looked into the problem and started troubleshooting it by looking through server logs and network configurations. Initially, he suspected a problem with network connectivity.
11:00 AM UTC - The engineer escalated the issue to the DevOps team, who began to investigate the application's backend services, assuming the issue was related to a server overload.
11:20 AM UTC - The DevOps team discovered that a misconfigured database connection was the root of the problem, not server congestion. They began to troubleshoot the database connection and verify the configuration.
11:45 AM UTC - Restarting the affected services and reconfiguring the database connection fixed the problem.
12:45 PM UTC - The incident was closed, and a postmortem analysis was initiated to identify the root cause and corrective measures.

ROOT CAUSE AND RESOLUTION.
A misconfigured database connection was the root cause of the outage, which resulted in a cascade failure of the backend services for our application. The misconfiguration led to the database being down, which in turn led to the failure of the application's services and the outage. Restarting the affected services and reconfiguring the database connection fixed the issue for good.

CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures will be taken:
Task 1: Conduct a thorough review of the database configuration and connection settings to ensure they are properly configured and documented.
Task 2: Implement automated monitoring and alerting for database connection issues to quickly detect and respond to similar issues.
Task 3: Enhance the application's error handling and logging mechanisms to provide more detailed information about the root cause of errors and outages.
Task 4: Conduct regular testing and simulation of the application's backend services to identify potential issues before they become critical.
Task 5: Develop a more comprehensive incident response plan that includes clear roles and responsibilities for each team involved in resolving incidents
